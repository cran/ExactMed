# ExactMed 0.3.0

* Added the new function `exactmed_cat()`, which computes mediation effects when the mediator is categorical.

* In `exactmed_c()` when used with case-control data, the residual mean square error (MSE) has been replaced by the *weighted* MSE as the estimator of the error variance ($\sigma^2$) of the mediator regression model. 

* Documentation fixes and updates.

* The function `exactmed()` can now calculate mediation effects with case-control data. 
The case-control functionality is also available with the function `exactmed_c()`.

* Added `print()` methods for correct display of output objects.
